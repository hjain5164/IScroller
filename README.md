# IScroller

This project consist of two parts:
### 1. IScroller Chrome Extension
This extension is developed using javascript deeplearn.js library. This extension helps the user to scroll the websites using gestures.

### 2. Website Integration
A Flask app is created and integrating the python code with the HTML code we can enable a scroll activity on the basis of gestures. 
Our logic was to first find the farthest point of the fingers i.e their co- ordinates and then check the Y - values of the co-ordinates to determine whether there is scroll up or down activity.
